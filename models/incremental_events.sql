-- How to work with incremental forward only models
-- step 1: `sqlmesh plan dev` to create this model for the first time and backfill for all of history
-- step 2: change the user_intent_level conditional value
-- step 3: pick a start date to backfill like: '2024-06-18'
-- step 4: validate only a portion of rows were backfilled: sqlmesh fetchdf "select * from tcloud_demo__dev.incremental_events"
-- step 5: `sqlmesh plan` to promote to prod with a virtual update, note: the dev backfill preview won't be reused for promotion and is only for dev purposes
-- step 6: sqlmesh plan --restate-model "tcloud_demo.incremental_events", to invoke a backfill to mirror dev's data preview
-- step 7: pick the same backfill start date for prod as dev's above: '2024-06-18'
-- step 8: validate changes to prod: sqlmesh fetchdf "select * from tcloud_demo.incremental_events"
-- Note: by default, only complete intervals are processed, so if today was 2024-06-21 and the day isn't over, it would NOT backfill the day's interval of data because it's not complete
